-- SQL views for beancount-sqlite analytics layer.
-- These are the intended query surface — only query views, never raw tables.
-- Each view flattens joins and metadata so callers get clean, named columns.
--
-- Rebuild strategy: DROP + CREATE so this script is idempotent.
-- Drop order: most-dependent views first.
